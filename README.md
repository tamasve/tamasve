- 👋 Hi, I’m Tamas Veres, an advanced software developer but junior in application programming.
- 👀 Recently I’m engaged in application software development, aiming to be a full stack developer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and practicing Java, Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, Spring Data JPA // JavaScript, Node.js, React, Redux, HTML, CSS and several relevant libraries.
- 💞️ I’m open and looking for the opportunities to collaborate on application projects.
